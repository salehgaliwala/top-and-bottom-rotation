# top-and-bottom-rotation
top and bottom rotation problem
You are given two integer arrays top and bottom that represent the top and bottom halves of dominoes respectively. Return the minimum number of rotations (i.e. the top value becomes the bottom value of the domino and the bottom value becomes the top value of the domino) you need to perform to make all the values in top the same or all the values in bottom the same.
Note: If it is not possible to make all the values in top or bottom the same, return -1.
